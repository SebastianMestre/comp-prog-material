Use properties of your problem to enhance the input data with additional properties. Use proportiers in your data to dervie algorithms.

Example: The task is to multiply N numbers with M digits in total. How can we do this quickly? First notice that multiplication is associtaive and commutative, so we are free to reorder terms however we want, and combine them in whichever way we chose. The best order always takes the two numbers with the fewest digits and combines them.

More generally, the solution to many problems doesn't change when we change the order of the input data. In these cases it's always wise to reorder the input data (often in increasing order).
